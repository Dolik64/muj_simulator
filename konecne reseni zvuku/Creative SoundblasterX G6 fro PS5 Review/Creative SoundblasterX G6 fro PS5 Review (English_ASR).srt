1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
the creative Sound Blaster xj6 amazing

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,280
device but is it worth it for the PS5

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,099
let's find out originally priced at

4
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:13,379
129.99 here in UK nowadays is constantly

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,900
on sale between 80 and 90 pounds there's

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,699
a 1.2 meter long micro USB to USB a

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,960
cable and a mini tosling to tosling

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,640
Cable in the Box

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,439
the device is completely made out of

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,939
plastic there's a digital volume dial at

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,980
the front which is accompanied by a

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,079
combo Jack so if your headset only has

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,939
one 3.5 object of mic will still work

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,278
there's also a separate mic check next

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,738
to it on the side of the device we have

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,840
three buttons one is for the Scout mode

17
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,879
the other is SBX and this one is a

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,520
switch for low and high gain

19
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,079
the rear we have a line and Optical in

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,820
and line and Optical out and the micro

21
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,200
USB port which is used for connection

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,820
and Power

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,739
the bottom of the device has this

24
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,299
massive rubber insert so on the desk it

25
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:53,159
stays securely

26
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:54,659
the setup and changes on the device only

27
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,578
done through the creative Sound Blaster

28
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,198
command software which is on the PC or

29
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,878
Mac there's a very handy guide

30
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:04,079
explaining what these different options

31
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:05,700
do we get a very nice 10 band EQ option

32
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,859
which one set will be saved onto the

33
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,379
device playback have different options

34
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,659
for the audio quality I found 24 bit 48

35
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:15,420
kilohertz to be the best for some reason

36
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,100
and a recording we have some very nice

37
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,140
and funny voice move options but

38
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,719
unfortunately they are only available on

39
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,819
the PC and don't work on the PlayStation

40
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,079
5.

41
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,000
so there are two ways of using the

42
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,039
device in the PS5 one with a USB only

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,959
method with very simple I'll just plug

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,118
the USB the system picks it up the other

45
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,618
is using a HDMI audio instructor let's

46
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,379
quickly take a look at the USB only

47
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:39,659
method the device is plugged in

48
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,399
and in our sound settings we can see the

49
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,920
input device is recognize the soundblast

50
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,140
xj6 and you can adjust the microphone

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,180
level and stuff the output again USB

52
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,379
headset if you're using the USB only

53
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,360
method we need to make sure the

54
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,379
headphones output the headphones set to

55
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,299
all audio

56
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,339
with the USB you have the ability to

57
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,780
enable 3D audio as well which is a big

58
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,180
Plus in my opinion

59
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,560
so now I have a setup with the HDMI

60
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,780
audio structure and feeding the device

61
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,920
with the optical input as well I'm just

62
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,180
quickly going to show you what we need

63
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,799
to do in terms of the settings on the

64
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,618
PS5

65
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,140
so only thing we need to change

66
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:15,300
is we need to go to the audio output and

67
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:18,000
the output to headphones we need to

68
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,219
change it to voice chat audio only this

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,378
will enable our HDMI device type we need

70
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:25,199
to change that from TV to AV amplifier

71
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:27,060
and change the channels from 2 to 5.1

72
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,219
this is what creative suggests and I got

73
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,360
the best results whilst you're doing

74
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,919
this as well

75
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,260
so just quickly going to show you guys

76
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,899
the operation on the device itself so

77
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:39,060
when the LED lights are white on by the

78
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,120
volume dial this means that we are in

79
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,819
the global volume control so the LEDs do

80
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,159
go brighter and dimmer depending what

81
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:50,399
you are doing if you press and hold the

82
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:52,859
dial it will turn red now when you turn

83
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,900
red there is a LED light on this side if

84
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,819
it's blinking that means your side tone

85
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,159
is disabled when it's ready if you pass

86
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:00,719
it one more time when the light is solid

87
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,840
that means the side tones being enabled

88
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,878
now if I change the if I basically move

89
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,560
the dial we can adjust how much of the

90
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,060
side tone you are hearing in your

91
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,519
headset

92
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,658
and if I want to disable it same thing I

93
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,840
need to make sure that I'm in the red

94
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:18,598
LED mode press it one more time LED this

95
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,060
tiny microphone LED blinking means that

96
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,859
the most iPhone has been disabled now if

97
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,539
I have the optical in and I press and

98
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,540
hold one more time

99
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:29,219
the top LED and the other LED they will

100
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:30,959
change green me so this is the voice mix

101
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:32,519
feature this you only get this if you

102
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,620
have the optical coming in if it's just

103
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,080
a USB if you were in the red mode you'll

104
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,658
go back into the into the white LED mode

105
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,819
so here what we do is if we rotate

106
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:43,739
counterclockwise now we're getting more

107
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:45,539
of the chat so blue LED means we're

108
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,400
getting more of the chat if we go all

109
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:51,179
the way when it blinks that means it's

110
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,500
just chat no game coming back is so when

111
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,360
it comes back to green that means we

112
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,658
have the perfect mix

113
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,519
and so this yellow orange is basically

114
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:01,620
now we're getting the game audio which

115
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,780
is counterclockwise if you do it so this

116
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,239
is like cutting out the chat and this is

117
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,060
just the game audio and blinking is that

118
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,620
we are the max so the same thing this is

119
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,299
like you bring it back to green that

120
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,420
means we have the perfect mixture of

121
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,340
both holding the volume dial again we

122
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,918
come back to the red LED and the white

123
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:22,439
LED here that means we are back into the

124
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,299
normal Global volume control

125
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,939
on this sides the buttons that we have

126
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,280
we can turn the Scout mode on off I

127
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:31,860
didn't like that the processing but this

128
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,198
is very useful the SBX button this when

129
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,479
the light is lit that means all the

130
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,759
processing I showed you that we set in

131
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,399
the command software that's been applied

132
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,520
right now if I press and turn it off

133
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,899
that means none of the the EQ and the

134
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,478
bass and whatever surround setting

135
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:51,060
nothing's been applied so you kind of

136
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,339
have some control over it press it again

137
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,019
now it's being applied so that's just a

138
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:56,819
quick overview of the function on the

139
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:58,198
device itself so let's talk about the

140
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,418
sound quality guys

141
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,699
I have to say using it in the USB only

142
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:04,799
mode playing Call of Duty was actually a

143
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,840
good experience I was using my e-port86

144
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,600
Pros which I had trouble getting a

145
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:12,179
decent volume out of from the GSX 300 in

146
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,639
the controller and this even in low gain

147
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,978
I just couldn't use those at full volume

148
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,460
so it was a very very decent experience

149
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:24,060
Battlefield was not that good so when I

150
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:26,698
got the optical in that's when this

151
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,819
thing really basically came to life and

152
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,400
uh using the optical the HTML audio

153
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,659
extraction and the optical setup

154
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:36,418
Battlefield has been absolutely amazing

155
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,160
I've heard people you know their pain

156
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:40,680
Point accuracy of the audio where it is

157
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,620
coming from the audio separation it's

158
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,500
mind-blowing people flanking you you

159
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,319
just hear them I I do this thing where I

160
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,759
change the scope so I can basically have

161
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,439
a bit of an upper hand in a close

162
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,060
quarter battle and then change it when

163
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,418
you know somebody's far away

164
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,538
absolutely amazing so for me

165
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:06,120
I think this device is only worth with

166
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:08,339
uh with the optical setup so now this is

167
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,620
the the value proposition basically

168
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:13,978
should you get this if you only have a

169
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,079
PS5 and if you don't have a PC I don't

170
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:18,180
think so I think you definitely need a

171
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,560
PC there is a way of using it without a

172
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,478
PC so you just completely turn

173
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,918
everything off because originally when

174
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,139
it comes out of the box there are a lot

175
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:26,939
of different things apply to it and if

176
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,160
you are using it in the USB mode you

177
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:31,620
need to make sure you don't have any of

178
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,660
the SBX processing done only the EQ that

179
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,120
you're doing so you kind of definitely

180
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,759
need a PC I wish there was a mobile app

181
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,639
or better an app on the PlayStation 5

182
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,520
itself so if you don't have an access to

183
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,220
a PC this is definitely not the device I

184
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,719
would I think the Sound Blaster X4

185
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,699
because they have the mobile app support

186
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,539
and it's got the optical in I think that

187
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:57,600
would be more suitable but if you have

188
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:59,579
an access to a a computer or a Mac and

189
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,000
you want to upgrade your audio I think

190
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:06,120
this is a really amazing I used it with

191
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,279
the A6 Pro open back the Sun as a HD 598

192
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,680
anything I put into it just sounded

193
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:14,038
absolutely amazing but that's with the

194
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,720
HDMI audio instructor without it it's

195
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,060
yeah it just gives you louder volume

196
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,400
it's a it's still decent but something

197
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,800
like the GSX 300 can sort of work as

198
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,258
well but at 80 pounds I have to say I

199
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,900
love this device I've recently acquired

200
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,060
the steelseries game deck Gen 2 so

201
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,679
please you know keep an eye out on my

202
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,439
channel I'll be doing a comparison of

203
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,840
that with this because that only has USB

204
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,939
and it has some features and stuff so

205
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,138
I'll be making a detailed comparison I

206
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,899
hope there was some useful information

207
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,460
in this video if I left anything out if

208
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:46,459
you want to know anything else about

209
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:49,620
this device please do leave me a comment

210
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:52,620
and I want to thank you to everyone who

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,478
